# Enhanced Q&A Chatbot

A lightweight question-answer web app built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI models**.  
It allows you to type any question, select a model, tune parameters like temperature and token limit, and get clear text responses ‚Äî all from a simple browser interface.

## üß© Overview

This project is designed to interact with large language models through an easy-to-use interface without writing repetitive code.  
The app combines a conversational prompt pipeline with Streamlit‚Äôs layout features to provide a minimal but functional Q&A chatbot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user enters a question into the text box on the main screen.

2. **Model Configuration:**  
   In the sidebar, you can:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key securely
   - Choose the model (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, or `gpt-4`)
   - Adjust temperature (controls randomness)
   - Set the maximum number of tokens (controls response length)

3. **Prompt Processing:**  
   The app uses a `ChatPromptTemplate` from LangChain to format the question and pass it to the selected model.

4. **Response Generation:**  
   The output is processed through `StrOutputParser` and displayed in real time in the Streamlit interface.
